## Sure Shot SAM

This is the code for our 2013 Robot, Sure Shot SAM. It is based off of the IterativeRobot class from WPILib. The main sections are organized as follows:

- __Team316Robot.h/Team316Robot.cpp__: Robot class definition and program wide functions
- __Team316RobotTeleop.cpp__: Teleop mode code
- __Team316RobotAutonomous.cpp__: Autonomous mode functions. Runs one of the programs found in the Autonomous/ directory.
- __RobotMap.h__: Mapping of robot I/O to constants
- __ControllerMap.h__: Mapping of controller input to constants

The code should be fairly well documented. We will continue to clean/update it over the summer.

We've also ported our robot code to Java. Check it out [here][1].
